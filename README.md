# Welcome to the Playground

Playground is a repository where I experiment with different programming languages
and implement various algorithms. It currently contains directories for **Go** and **C**,
each with their own subdirectory where I implement various algorithms in the respective language.

## Table of Contents

- [Go](#go)
- [C](#c)

## Go

The [go](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/tree/main/go) directory contains
helpful learning and productivity packages written with the `Go` programming language.
The packages in the go directory are fully functional and maintained and can be used in real programmes.
Go is a statically typed language with a focus on simplicity and performance,
making it a great choice for building scalable systems.

### Search Algorithms

In the [searchalgorithms](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/tree/main/go/searchalgorithms) subdirectory,
I've implemented several search algorithms in Go, including:

- [Binary search](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/blob/main/go/searchalgorithms/binary_search.go)
- [Linear search](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/blob/main/go/searchalgorithms/linear_search.go)
- [Exponential search](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/blob/main/go/searchalgorithms/exponential_search.go)
- [Interpolation search](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/blob/main/go/searchalgorithms/interpolation_search.go)
- [Jump search](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/blob/main/go/searchalgorithms/jump_search.go)

You can find the source code for these algorithms in the [go/searchalgorithms](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/tree/main/go/searchalgorithms)
directory.

#### Resources

If you're interested in learning more about Go, here are some resources I've found helpful:

- [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io/): A comprehensive guide to the Go programming language.
- [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1): An interactive tour of Go that covers the language's features and syntax.
- [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html): A guide to writing clear and idiomatic Go code.

## C

The [c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/tree/main/c) directory contains my experiments
with the C programming language. C is a low-level language that's widely used for systems programming and embedded systems.

### Search Algorithms

You can find the source code for these algorithms in the [c/searchalgorithms](https://github.com/chee-zaram/playground/tree/main/c/searchalgorithms)
directory.

#### Resources

If you're interested in learning more about C, here are some resources I've found helpful:

- [Sams Teach Yourself C in 24 Hours](https://books.google.com.ng/books/about/Sams_Teach_Yourself_C_in_24_Hours.html?id=YH47PgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y):
  A book that covers the basics of C programming. Highly recommended.
- [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628):
  A classic book on the C programming language, written by its creators.
- [Learn C the Hard Way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/): A free online book that teaches C programming through a series of exercises.
